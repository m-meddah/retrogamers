# RetroGamers

This repository contains the final project from scratch from my formation at O'clock.  
We made it with 4 sprints, during the month of June 2022.  
The code is the same as we made the presentation in live from Youtube the June, 30 2022.  
You can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIDnFgl761A&ab_channel=O%27clock), at 08:30 we made the demo of our app (but my Virtual Machine crashed during the live, hopefully Allan, the Lead Dev Front continue to share the screen).

I am the Product Owner of the application, and the Lead Dev Back, as I coded the api folder alone.  
I hope you will like the way I coded the API.
